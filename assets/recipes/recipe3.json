It's not flashy, and it didn't grab me as anything special. Honestly, it didn't occur to me until I started eating it how incredibly nuanced it actually is. First, it's the juiciest, tenderest, oven-prepared chicken I've ever had (I bake it until the thickest part of the chicken shows 155¬∞, which took about 35-40 minutes total). I don't know if it's the alcohol in the wine or the acid in the lemon juice, but the inside of that chicken is just so beautifully cooked. Second, the seasoning is just out of this world. It's still hard for me to believe how good it is despite having such common ingredients. But the combination of the herb paste (I went heavy on the thyme, oregano, and minced garlic) and the white wine mixture gives the chicken a depth of flavor that...well...that I really just cannot shut up about.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Kerbaugh"},"reviewBody":"I let my seven year old daughter help me cook this tonight. She loves to cook - but eating is a whole different story. First words out of her mouth are usually ‚Äúthis is disgusting.‚Äù So, needless to say, I was a bit nervous with this. She watched as I measured out each of the ingredients and she helped pour it all over the chicken (we got busy talking and forgot the brown sugar üò¨) - but when the final product came out of the oven - wow! It looked divine and my house smelled so good. I served this on top of cous cous and with a side of roasted Brussel sprouts. As my daughter ate I watched and waited - she looked at me with a big ol‚Äô smile and said ‚Äúthis is delicious!‚Äù Even my husband, who is not a lemon fan - and who gets nervous when I try new recipes - loved it! He said the lemon was a good taste for the summer, and even suggested we try this recipe with white fish. So, overall - if these two crazies like it - it‚Äôs a great recipe and we will be having this again!!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Collins Tarrant"},"reviewBody":"Excellent recipe.  We pulled it from the oven at 150¬∫ and climbing.  I poured the sauce into a small sauce pan and reduced it for about 10 minutes, then poured it over the chicken breasts.  My husband loved the sauce so much he dipped his bread into in and ate it all up.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"dakotataylor22"},"reviewBody":"This was delicious!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Betsy Kenerson"},"reviewBody":"This is one of those recipes that ends up tasting as good as you think it will. Not skimping on the garlic pays off without being overbearing. Then the white wine and lemon zest hit every taste bud. Have to admit I used half the thyme & oregano called for. Just personal preference. I could eat this sauce on EVERYTHING except dessert...it's that good. Savoured each bite with roasted broccoli and pappardelle al limone I made yesterday. Not bad for a Monday night. :)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"GrubMommy"},"reviewBody":"OH GOODNESS, THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!
